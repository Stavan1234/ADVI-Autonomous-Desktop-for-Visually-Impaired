Memory evidence policy:

You may use the entire conversation, including USER and ASSISTANT
messages, to understand context and resolve incomplete or messy
user statements.

However, distinguish carefully between:

1. USER-STATED FACT
   A fact explicitly stated by the user.

2. USER-CONFIRMED FACT
   A fact proposed by ADVI and explicitly confirmed by the user.

3. ASSISTANT INFERENCE
   A fact introduced only by ADVI/Groq/Gemini without user
   confirmation.

4. UNCERTAIN INFORMATION
   Anything ambiguous or insufficiently supported.

Only store information as durable memory when it is:
- explicitly stated by the user, or
- explicitly confirmed by the user.

Assistant-generated wording may be used to interpret or clarify
the user's meaning, but assistant guesses must never become facts
solely because ADVI said them.

For names, email addresses, relationships, identities, jobs,
preferences, ownership, and similar personal facts, require
explicit user support or confirmation.        

Relationships are optional.

Extract a relationship only when the conversation
explicitly establishes it.

Examples:

"The user's father is Devdan Kalkumbe."
→
{{
  "subject": "Stavan Kalkumbe",
  "relation": "father",
  "object": "Devdan Kalkumbe",
  "confidence": 0.98
}}

"Pradeep is my uncle and Ramanika is his daughter."
→
{{
  "subject": "Pradeep",
  "relation": "daughter",
  "object": "Ramanika",
  "confidence": 0.98
}}

Do NOT infer relationships that were not explicitly
established.

Do not create relationships from guesses.        
Analyze this completed ADVI conversation.

Keep ONLY information that is likely to remain useful
across future sessions.

Do NOT store:
- temporary questions
- ordinary factual answers
- transient tasks
- debugging noise
- assumptions
- filler

Potentially store:
- stable user facts
- stable preferences
- important project decisions
- persistent context

For every memory, create a natural, self-contained
statement specifically useful for semantic retrieval.

Examples:

User says:
"I study at FCRIT Vashi."

Return:
{{
  "category": "user",
  "key": "institution",
  "value": "FCRIT Vashi",
  "statement": "The user studies at FCRIT Vashi.",
  "confidence": 0.98
}}

User says:
"I am a fourth year computer engineering student."

Return:
{{
  "category": "user",
  "key": "education",
  "value": "Fourth-year computer engineering student",
  "statement": "The user is a fourth-year computer engineering student.",
  "confidence": 0.98
}}

The statement must:
- be short
- be factual
- be self-contained
- contain enough meaning for semantic retrieval
- contain no assumptions

Return ONLY valid JSON:

{{
  "summary": "Very short session summary.",
  "memories": [
    {{
      "category": "user|preference|project",
      "key": "short_key",
      "value": "structured durable value",
      "statement": "natural factual statement",
      "confidence": 0.0
    }}
  ],
  "relationships": [
  {{
    "subject": "Stavan Kalkumbe",
    "relation": "father",
    "object": "Devdan Kalkumbe",
    "confidence": 0.98
  }}
]
}}
